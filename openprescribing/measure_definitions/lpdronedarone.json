    "Dronedarone was originally approved to prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation, or to lower the heart rate ",
    "in adults who have had or have non-permanent atrial fibrillation. In September 2011 this indication was restricted",
    "to the maintenance of normal heart rhythm in ‘persistent’ or ‘paroxysmal’ atrial fibrillation after normal heart ",
    "rhythm has been restored.",
    "<a href='https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG180'> NICE clinical guideline on Atrial Fibrillation</a> ",
    "puts greater emphasis on rate rather than rhythm control and has clarified the place of dronedarone in the treatment pathway."
