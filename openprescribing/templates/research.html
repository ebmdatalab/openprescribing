<p>The DataLab is a mixed team of clinicians, academics, and software engineers, all pooling knowledge and skills to create tools like OpenPrescribing.net. We build all our informatics tools in-house, which means our academic research is fully integrated with our software development. Our research program spans four streams of work:</p>



<ol><li>Innovative informatics methods; </li><li>Practice variation; </li><li>Behaviour change; </li><li>Policy analysis on prescribing and informatics. </li></ol>



<p></p>



<p><strong>1. OpenPrescribing “Informatics Methods” Papers</strong></p>



<p>We publish research papers on the innovative informatics methods we have developed to run our interactive data tools.<br></p>

<p><strong>The OpenPrescribing Database</strong></p>



<p>We have substantial back-end processes for rapidly importing, processing and matching prescribing data, demographic and clinical information, deprivation scores, age profiles, list sizes, QoF, and more, with a regular cycle of data updates. This is held in a highly optimised and indexed Postgres database to drive our online tools, and mirrored in BigQuery for rapid research queries. <br></p>



<p><strong>The EBM DataLab Approach</strong></p>



<p>We are very different to other teams, because we pool skills and build all our digital tools in-house. The traditional route to building an informatics service is slow: some senior managers write a specification document, that is given to a software company, who bid a price, and deliver a product 18 months later. Our approach is different: clinicians, academics, and software engineers all work together, to produce rapidly iterating prototypes that are launched and used by the community, with open feedback from all. <br></p>



<p>This is important: it means we are fast. But more than that, it means we now have clinicians and academics who know about software development, and software developers who know about medical data and evidence-based medicine. Our traditional academic researchers and clinicians can work creatively with software tools such as Python, Jupyter notebooks, Github, Pandas, SQL, and more; they know what is possible with the tools our developers use, so they can be creative in developing new ideas and services. Similarly, our software engineers understand the problems we’re trying to fix in evidence based medicine, clinical trials, prescribing data, and NHS informatics; so they can be much more creative and efficient. <br></p>



<p>As a consequence of our approach we are able to innovate on short cycles, develop new approaches to data, prototype for rapid testing, and deliver working tools and papers efficiently. Because the DataLab team works across a range of outputs including research integrity, clinical trials, prescribing data, and clinical informatics, we can pool insights across a range of fields. We follow a flexible approach, based on the principles on agile software development. We share all our code on github. We share all our data alongside our papers. <br></p>



<p><strong>Future DataLab Activity</strong></p>



<p>We have a range of new tools in other areas of medicine under development. Closely related to our work on prescribing we are creating <a href="https://openpathology.net/">OpenPathology.net</a>. We have a wide range of additional OpenPrescribing research planned around our existing four themes above, including new RCTs and new data science approaches to describing and improving the diffusion of innovation in the NHS; further papers on variation in trends; and more. We are developing new teaching programmes around clinical informatics, and specific teaching and online training around prescribing and prescribing data for clinicians and pharmacists. We are embarking on a programme of practical applied policy research around better use of data in healthcare, and have close links with the policy community. In the DataLab more broadly we also have a wide portfolio of projects in progress across other areas of science, including extensive work on clinical trial methods and reporting, our high impact TrialsTracker.net, and retracted.net. <br></p>



<p><strong>Get in touch</strong></p>



<p>We are actively seeking funds for more staff to deliver more tools and papers. Some of our best work comes from open collaboration with clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and students: if you would like to work with us then please get in touch. If you want to send a CV, then 2 pages on skills and interests is good. <br></p>



<p><em>We are especially keen to hear from:</em></p>



<ul><li>Software engineers, clinicians, researchers or students who want to work with us.</li><li>Anyone who uses data in their current clinical / policy role and has hit a problem.</li><li>Policymakers with interesting problems for us to fix.</li><li>Researchers who have hit policy barriers in their work with data.</li><li>Funders who can help us deliver more tools, more papers, and train more workforce.</li></ul>
