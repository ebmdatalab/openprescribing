    Given a list of CSV files, sort the rows by the supplied column names and
    write the result to `output_filename`

    Input files may be gzipped or not (either will work). The output is
    always gzipped.

    We shell out to the `sort` command for this as it much more efficient than
    trying to do this in Python and can transparently handle sorting files that
    are many times too large to fit in memory.

    Note that `sort` doesn't really parse CSV, it just splits on commas; so
    this function won't work where the CSV contains commas -- at least, where
    these are to the left of the columns which are being sorted on.
