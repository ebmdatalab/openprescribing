"""
Drugs prescribed generically should always be dispensed at the tariff price.
However, it turns out it's possible to prescribe a generic drug but specify the
manufacturer. This extra bit of specification doesn't show up in our data as
it's not sufficiently granular so it just looks like an ordinary generic. But
the price paid can be much greater than the tariff price. We call these Ghost
Branded Generics.

A further complication is that we don't always know what the correct tariff
price is; the BSA's internal version doesn't always match the published
version. So we attempt to infer the correct price by looking at all prescribing
of that drug and finding the median price.
