  "Nebivolol is a beta-blocker used in heart failure. Many patients can't tolerate a full 5mg dose. ",
  "However, the 2.5mg tablet is 45 times more expensive than the equivalent number of 5mg tablets, which are scored so they can be broken. ",
  "Ideally, the 2.5mg tablets should be reserved for patients who are unable to tolerate the full dose and are also unable to break the 5mg tablets in half."
