    "Soluble and effervescent preparations of analgesics contain high sodium content.",
    "8 soluble paracetamol per day will exceed the recommended sodium intake for an adult of 2.4g (6g salt).",
    "In addition, these products are considerably more expensive than standard tablets or capsules.",
    "Therefore, ideally they should only be recommended in patients with genuine swallowing difficulties."
