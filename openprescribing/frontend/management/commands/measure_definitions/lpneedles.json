    "Insulin pen needles range in price between approximately £3.95 to £30.00 per box. There is no evidence that suggests ",
    "that there are any significant differences between brands of needles, although there are reommendations about length of needle. ",

    "<br><br><strong>This measure is currently under consultation.  ",
