# We get information about which CCG a practice belongs to from epraccur.csv,
# which is usually published quarterly.  When a CCG's composition changes,
# closed or dormant practices that were previously in the CCG are often not
# updated and may end up apparently belonging to a closed CCG.  We call these
# "orphan practices".
#
# When several practices that were in a CCG leave that CCG, there are three
# cases we need to consider:
#
# A: the CCG has closed and its practices have moved to a single CCG
# B: the CCG has closed and its practices have moved to multiple CCGs
# C: the CCG is still open but some practices have moved to another CCG
#
# We have seen case A several times in the wild, especially when CCGs have
# merged.  We have seen case C once, when the boundary between CCGs O1H and 01K
# changed.
#
# In cases A and B, the closed CCG might leave behind orphan practices.  In
# case A, we can automatically identify which CCG the orphan practices should
# be moved to.  In case B, human intervention would be required, perhaps
# involving looking at the location of the orphan practices and comparing these
# to the locations of the active practices that have moved CCGs.
#
# In case C, the original CCG might have some closed practices that should have
# been moved to a new CCG.  Again, this requires human intervention.
#
# When a human needs to get involved, a message will be sent to Slack.
#
# To manually move a practice to a new CCG, you will need to update
# Practice.ccg_id and Practice.ccg_change_reason.
