    "Many people with diabetes test their blood glucose levels, using a blood glucose meter, in order to help control their diabetes by adjusting diet and the dose of medicines. ",
    "Users use a “lancet” in order to prick their finger to draw a drop of blood for use with the meter.  These lancets fit specific lancing devices, and are only used once.</p>",
