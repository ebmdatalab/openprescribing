<p>Hello from OpenPrescribing!</p>

<p>We recently found out that NHSMail has been discarding all the emails we've been sending.</p>

<p>As a result, we think that when you signed up for monthly alerts about {{ user.profile.most_recent_bookmark.topic }}, you never received an email requesting that you confirm this.</p>

<p>So, to confirm, please follow <a href="{{ activate_url }}">this link</a>.</p>

<p>If you no longer want to receive alerts about prescribing behaviour, just ignore this email.</p>

<p>Thanks, and apologies for the inconvenience,</p>

<p>The OpenPrescribing team<br>
